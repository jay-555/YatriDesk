# Integrations hub

Settings → Integrations lets a restaurant connect YatriDesk to outside
platforms **using its own accounts and credentials**. Nothing routes through a
central YatriDesk server; the credentials belong to the restaurant and are stored
on its own installation, encrypted.

## What works today

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| Hub: connect, configure, test, enable/disable, disconnect, activity log | Working, tested |
| Encrypted credential storage (AES-256-GCM, bound to restaurant + provider) | Working, tested |
| Outgoing webhooks (HMAC-signed, retries, delivery history) | Working (Settings → Webhooks) |
| Incoming orders / API access (scoped, expiring, rotatable keys) | Working (Settings → API Keys; `/api/v1/integrations/*`) |
| **Zomato, Swiggy, other aggregators** | **Working: signed inbound webhook** (see below) |

## Zomato, Swiggy and aggregators

Zomato and Swiggy have no public order API: restaurants receive their orders
through the platform's merchant webhook or an aggregator / channel manager
(UrbanPiper, Petpooja, Dotpe and similar) that the restaurant has an account
with. YatriDesk therefore exposes one signed endpoint per restaurant and
provider (`zomato`, `swiggy`, `aggregator`); Settings -> Integrations shows the
exact URL and a secret generator.

    POST /api/v1/integration-hub/webhook/<restaurantId>/<provider>
    X-YatriDesk-Timestamp: <unix seconds>
    X-YatriDesk-Signature: sha256=<hex HMAC-SHA256(secret, timestamp + "." + rawBody)>

Events (JSON body):

| `event` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ping` | Proves the secret works; marks the card **Connected**. |
| `order.created` | Creates an ONLINE order awaiting acceptance (`externalSource` = provider, `externalOrderId` = `orderId`). `customer{name,phone,email?,ref?}`, `delivery{address,pincode?}` (required for `type: DELIVERY`, the default), `items[{name or menuItemId, quantity, kitchenNote?}]`, optional `branchId` (required when the restaurant has several branches), `notes`, `paymentMode` (`PREPAID` / `COD`, written into the order note). |
| `order.cancelled` | Declines the order if it is still waiting for acceptance; if staff already accepted it, an activity-log warning asks a person to decide. |

Guarantees: the signature covers the exact bytes received and is compared in
constant time; deliveries more than 5 minutes off are refused (replay bound); a
repeated `orderId` returns the existing order instead of a second one; every
refusal is a plain 401 so the endpoint reveals nothing about which restaurants
exist. Prices, tax and fees are **never** read from the payload - they are
recomputed from your live menu. An unknown dish refuses the whole order (422,
visible in the activity log) rather than silently dropping a line. Items in a
category hidden from the website are refused too.

The card turns **Connected** only after a correctly signed delivery really
arrived; saving the secret or pressing *Check status* never does. Not built:
sending accept / reject / ready back to the platform (that needs each
platform's outbound API and sandbox), so staff still confirm status inside the
platform or the aggregator.

## Statuses

`NOT_CONNECTED`, `PENDING_CONFIGURATION`, `CONNECTED`, `SYNC_ERROR`,
`AUTH_EXPIRED`, `DISABLED`. Only an adapter's own `testConnection` can set
`CONNECTED`; saving credentials never does.

## Writing an adapter

1. Implement `IntegrationProvider` (`src/integration-hub/providers/provider.ts`):
   `key`, `name`, `category`, `capabilities`, `credentialFields`, and
   `testConnection`. Implement the optional methods (`updateOrderStatus`,
   `processWebhook`, `refreshCredentials`) only for capabilities you set to
   `true` — the hub never calls an operation the adapter did not declare.
2. Register it in `providers/registry.ts`.
3. Add tests next to `test/integration-hub.e2e-spec.ts`.

Nothing in POS, KDS or order management changes: an adapter that receives
orders should create them through the existing order service as an ONLINE order
requiring acceptance, setting `externalSource` + `externalOrderId` (unique per
branch, so a retried delivery cannot create a second order) and
`externalCustomerRef`. Those columns already exist on `Order`.

## Security rules for adapters

- Credentials arrive decrypted only inside `ProviderContext` for one call;
  never log them or put them in an error message.
- Only use the platform's official API with credentials issued to the
  restaurant. No scraping, private endpoints or browser automation.
- Validate any callback URL (see `modules/webhooks/net-guard.ts` for the SSRF
  guard) and verify webhook signatures with a constant-time comparison, a
  timestamp window and replay protection.

## Configuration

`INTEGRATION_SECRET_KEY` (16+ characters) is the encryption key. If unset, a
key is derived from `JWT_SECRET`, which means **rotating `JWT_SECRET` makes
saved credentials unreadable** (the hub then reports *Authentication expired*
and asks for them again). Set a dedicated key in production and back it up.

## Permissions

All hub routes need `settings.manage`. The restaurant is always taken from the
signed-in session, never from the request.
